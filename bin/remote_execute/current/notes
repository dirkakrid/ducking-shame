right
problem... 
cant read input from the server port and pipe it through gpg...
netcat connection doesnt close
never hits gpg

epoch time date +%s because the only google result for time stamp checking in bash was to touch a file and compare the time it was made hmmm
seconds since 00:00:00 Jan 1 1970...

should atleast make it easier to timestamp +60 seconds from execute

im assuming the entire thing is going to have some problems around the 57-60 seconds mark

from script gen iptables rules timestamp 

but it can just reknock if less than 10 seconds remaining? 

wont be a problem but i cant get netcat to pull a file and auto close or ide be done by now

dumping some slightly obtuse iptables rules to just set this up and test on localhost...
